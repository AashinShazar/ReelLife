# ReelLife


## Who's it for?
Any and every content creator. We aspire to branch out to all mediums of content but for now focus on the visual sort.
Examples of ReelLife users:

* Movie industry professional seeking to make trailers, promo material (posters, insta posts, tweets and online ad campaigns)
* Bloggers, magazines and photographers covering issues/events

## Core Tech
ReelLife is coded entirely in python, and runs on a Google Cloud virtual machine instance. Our Convolutional Neural Network was built using the Keras library with Tensorflow as the backend. We also used the cv2, pytube, sci-kit, and various other data science and python libraries. The dataset used to build the machine learning model was largely found on film-grab .

ReelLife is trained to find only the shots which best show off your videos and the people in them. Our convolutional neural network lives on Google Cloud server and is trained to find only the best shots, you can cut down on the time needed to find what you need.
