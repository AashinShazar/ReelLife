Who's it for?
Any and every content creator. We aspire to branch out to all mediums of content but for now focus on the visual sort.
Examples of ReelLife users:

Instagram influencer selecting the best snapshot to post that will have the highest conversion advertising a product
Pinterest or Reddit Subreddit user who want's to post themed content pictures that serve to highlight a subject
Movie industry professional seeking to make trailers, promo material (posters, insta posts, tweets and online ad campaigns)
Bloggers, magazines and photographers covering issues/events

Core Tech
You give us the set of pictures or videos that you'd like the highlights of, and ReelLife returns a set of 
curated photos to you in a specified folder. That's the hope for a future iteration. For now, we enjoy 
the simpler times.

ReelLife is trained to find only the shots which best show off your videos and the people in them. 
Our convolutional neural network lives on Google Cloud server and is trained to find only the best shots, 
you can cut down on the time needed to find what you need.
